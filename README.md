## Run the game on web browser

- Use a web server like XAMPP and open index.html through localhost.
- Alternatively, you can use the "Live Server" extension in VSCode to open index.html.

## Execute the unit tests

- Execute `run_tests.sh` or `npm test` command
- Also you can run `run_tests_watch.sh` or `npm run testw` command to use jest in watch mode

## Build to web

- Execute `run.sh` or `npm run build` command
- Wait until the process finish
- Open index.html in VSCode and use Open with live server option (from Live Server VSCode extension)
