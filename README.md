# Gif Tower Defense Game

This is an attempt to rewrite my old game Gif Tower Defense (2012) originally made with processingjs now using p5.js and JavaScript. *(THIS APPLICATION IS IN AN EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT)*

## Execute the game

- Use a web server like XAMPP and open index.html through localhost.
- Alternatively, you can use the "Live Server" extension in VSCode to open index.html.
