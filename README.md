# Gif Tower Defense Game

This is an attempt to rewrite my old game Gif Tower Defense (2012) originally made with processingjs now using p5.js and JavaScript, for learning purposes. *(THIS APPLICATION IS IN AN EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT)*

## Execute the game

- Use a web server like XAMPP and open index.html through localhost.
- Alternatively, you can use the "Live Server" extension in VSCode to open index.html.

### Tasks

- [x] Start with a basic canvas test
- [x] Include p5.min.js locally, set background dark and put some images
- [x] Create a basic Tower Class, and display it
- [ ] More tasks coming soon...
